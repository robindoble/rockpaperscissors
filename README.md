RockPaperScissors
==========

Rockpaperscissors was a neat intro to Javascript. All code is written entirely in JS and was test driven with Jasmine. Despite it being a small project it introduced many new learning points. The user can play a wacky variation of rockpaperscissors against a computer that chooses its move randomly
